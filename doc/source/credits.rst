Contributions to **DREAMTools** are direct (e.g. by contributing to the code in  the github repository http://github.com/dreamtools/dreamtools) or indirectly (e.g., by developing an original scoring functions in DREAM challenges). Since **DREAMTools** framework is dynamic by nature, we won't keep a list of contributors, which would be outdated quickly. Instead, we recommend to check the scoring module themselves (e.g., dreamtools/dream5/D5C2/scoring.py) or the github log, the DREAM website (http://dreamchallenges.org), or the Synapse web of the challenge itself.
